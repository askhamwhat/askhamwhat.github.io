  title={Norm-preserving discretization of integral equations for elliptic {PDE}s with internal layers {I}: the one-dimensional case},
  author={Askham, Travis and Greengard, Leslie},
  abstract={We investigate the behavior of integral formulations of variable coefficient elliptic partial differential equations in the presence of steep internal layers. In one dimension, the equations that arise can be solved analytically and the condition numbers estimated in various Lp norms. We show that high-order accurate Nystrom discretization leads to well-conditioned finite-dimensional linear systems if and only if the discretization is both norm-preserving in a correctly chosen Lp space and adaptively refined in the internal layer.},

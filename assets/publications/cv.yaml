  abstract: We investigate the behavior of integral formulations of variable coefficient
    elliptic partial differential equations in the presence of steep internal layers.
    In one dimension, the equations that arise can be solved analytically and the
    condition numbers estimated in various Lp norms. We show that high-order accurate
    Nystrom discretization leads to well-conditioned finite-dimensional linear systems
    if and only if the discretization is both norm-preserving in a correctly chosen
    Lp space and adaptively refined in the internal layer.

  title: An adaptive fast multipole accelerated poisson solver for complex geometries
  container-title: Journal of Computational Physics
  publisher: Elsevier
  page: '1-22'
  volume: '344'
  abstract: We present a fast, direct and adaptive Poisson solver for complex two-dimensional
    geometries based on potential theory and fast multipole acceleration. More precisely,
    the solver relies on the standard decomposition of the solution as the sum of
    a volume integral to account for the source distribution and a layer potential
    to enforce the desired boundary condition. The volume integral is computed by
    applying the FMM on a square box that encloses the domain of interest. For the
    sake of efficiency and convergence acceleration, we first extend the source distribution
    (the right-hand side in the Poisson equation) to the enclosing box as a C0 function
    using a fast, boundary integral-based method. We demonstrate on multiply connected
    domains with irregular boundaries that this continuous extension leads to high
    accuracy without excessive adaptive refinement near the boundary and, as a result,
    to an extremely efficient “black box” fast solver.

  title: Integral equation formulation of the biharmonic dirichlet problem
  container-title: Journal of Scientific Computing
  publisher: Springer US
  page: '762-781'
  volume: '75'
  issue: '2'
  abstract: We present a novel integral representation for the biharmonic Dirichlet
    problem. To obtain the representation, the Dirichlet problem is first converted
    into a related Stokes problem for which the Sherman–Lauricella integral representation
    can be used. Not all potentials for the Dirichlet problem correspond to a potential
    for Stokes flow, and vice-versa, but we show that the integral representation
    can be augmented and modified to handle either simply or multiply connected domains.
    The resulting integral representation has a kernel which behaves better on domains
    with high curvature than existing representations. Thus, this representation results
    in more robust computational methods for the solution of the Dirichlet problem
    of the biharmonic equation and we demonstrate this with several numerical examples.

  title: A stabilized separation of variables method for the modified biharmonic equation
  container-title: Journal of Scientific Computing
  publisher: Springer US
  page: '1-24'
  abstract: The modified biharmonic equation is encountered in a variety of application
    areas, including streamfunction formulations of the Navier–Stokes equations. We
    develop a separation of variables representation for this equation in polar coordinates,
    for either the interior or exterior of a disk, and derive a new class of special
    functions which makes the approach stable. We discuss how these functions can
    be used in conjunction with fast algorithms to accelerate the solution of the
    modified biharmonic equation or the “bi-Helmholtz” equation in more complex geometries.

  page: '1341-1353'

  abstract: We consider a new class of periodic solutions to the Lugiato–Lefever equations
    (LLE) that govern the electromagnetic field in a microresonator cavity. Specifically,
    we rigorously characterize the stability and dynamics of the Jacobi elliptic function
    solutions of the LLE and show that the dn solution is stabilized by the pumping
    of the microresonator. In analogy with soliton perturbation theory, we also derive
    a microcomb perturbation theory that allows one to consider the effects of physically
    realizable perturbations on the combline stability, including effects of Raman
    scattering and stimulated emission. Our results are verified through full numerical
    simulations of the LLE cavity dynamics. The perturbation theory gives a simple
    analytic platform for potentially engineering new resonator designs.

  title: Robust and scalable methods for the dynamic mode decomposition
  container-title: arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.01883
  abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a broadly applicable dimensionality
    reduction algorithm that approximates a matrix containing time-series data by
    the outer product of a matrix of exponentials, representing Fourier-like time
    dynamics, and a matrix of coefficients, representing spatial structures. This
    interpretable spatio-temporal decomposition is commonly computed using linear
    algebraic techniques in its simplest formulation or a nonlinear optimization procedure
    within the variable projection framework. For data with sparse outliers or data
    which are not well-represented by exponentials in time, the standard Frobenius
    norm fit of the data creates significant biases in the recovered time dynamics.
    As a result, practitioners are left to clean such defects from the data manually
    or to use a black-box cleaning approach like robust PCA. As an alternative, we
    propose a framework and a set of algorithms for incorporating robust features
    into the nonlinear optimization used to compute the DMD itself. The algorithms
    presented are flexible, allowing for regu- larizers and constraints on the optimization,
    and scalable, using a stochastic approach to decrease the computational cost for
    data in high dimensional space. Both synthetic and real data examples are provided.

  container-title: SIAM Journal on Applied Dynamical Systems

  page: '380-416'

  issue: '1'
  abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a leading tool for data-driven
    modeling of dynamical systems, providing a regression framework for fitting linear
    dynamical models to time-series measurement data. We present a simple algorithm
    for computing an optimized version of the DMD for data which may be collected
    at unevenly spaced sample times. By making use of the variable projection method
    for nonlinear least squares problems, the algorithm is capable of solving the
    underlying nonlinear optimization problem efficiently. We explore the performance
    of the algorithm with some numerical examples for synthetic and real data from
    dynamical systems and find that the resulting decomposition displays less bias
    in the presence of noise than standard DMD algorithms. Because of the flexibility
    of the algorithm, we also present some interesting new options for DMD-based analysis.

  title: Greedy sensor placement with cost constraints
  container-title: arXiv preprint arXiv:1805.03717
  abstract: The problem of optimally placing sensors under a cost constraint arises
    naturally in the design of industrial and commercial products, as well as in scientific
    experiments. We consider a relaxation of the full optimization formulation of
    this problem and then extend a well-established QR-based greedy algorithm for
    the optimal sensor placement problem without cost constraints. We demonstrate
    the effectiveness of this algorithm on data sets related to facial recognition,
    climate science, and fluid mechanics. This algorithm is scalable and often identifies
    sparse sensors with near optimal reconstruction performance, while dramatically
    reducing the overall cost of the sensors. We find that the cost-error landscape
    varies by application, with intuitive connections to the underlying physics. Additionally,
    we include experiments for various pre-processing techniques and find that a popular
    technique based on the singular value decomposition is often sub-optimal.

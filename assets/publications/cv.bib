  author={Askham, Travis and Greengard, Leslie},
  abstract={We investigate the behavior of integral formulations of variable coefficient elliptic partial differential equations in the presence of steep internal layers. In one dimension, the equations that arise can be solved analytically and the condition numbers estimated in various Lp norms. We show that high-order accurate Nystrom discretization leads to well-conditioned finite-dimensional linear systems if and only if the discretization is both norm-preserving in a correctly chosen Lp space and adaptively refined in the internal layer.},

  abstract={We present a fast, direct and adaptive {P}oisson solver for complex two-dimensional geometries based on potential theory and fast multipole acceleration. More precisely, the solver relies on the standard decomposition of the solution as the sum of a volume integral to account for the source distribution and a layer potential to enforce the desired boundary condition. The volume integral is computed by applying the FMM on a square box that encloses the domain of interest. For the sake of efficiency and convergence acceleration, we first extend the source distribution (the right-hand side in the {P}oisson equation) to the enclosing box as a {C}0 function using a fast, boundary integral-based method. We demonstrate on multiply connected domains with irregular boundaries that this continuous extension leads to high accuracy without excessive adaptive refinement near the boundary and, as a result, to an extremely efficient “black box” fast solver.},

  abstract={We present a novel integral representation for the biharmonic Dirichlet problem. To obtain the representation, the Dirichlet problem is first converted into a related Stokes problem for which the Sherman–Lauricella integral representation can be used. Not all potentials for the Dirichlet problem correspond to a potential for Stokes flow, and vice-versa, but we show that the integral representation can be augmented and modified to handle either simply or multiply connected domains. The resulting integral representation has a kernel which behaves better on domains with high curvature than existing representations. Thus, this representation results in more robust computational methods for the solution of the Dirichlet problem of the biharmonic equation and we demonstrate this with several numerical examples.},

  abstract={The modified biharmonic equation is encountered in a variety of application areas, including streamfunction formulations of the Navier–Stokes equations. We develop a separation of variables representation for this equation in polar coordinates, for either the interior or exterior of a disk, and derive a new class of special functions which makes the approach stable. We discuss how these functions can be used in conjunction with fast algorithms to accelerate the solution of the modified biharmonic equation or the “bi-Helmholtz” equation in more complex geometries.},

Specifically, we rigorously characterize the stability and dynamics of the Jacobi elliptic function solutions of the LLE and show that the dn solution is stabilized by the pumping of the microresonator. In analogy with soliton perturbation theory, we also derive a microcomb perturbation theory that allows one to consider the effects of physically realizable perturbations on the combline stability, including effects of Raman scattering and stimulated emission. Our results are verified through full numerical simulations of the LLE cavity dynamics. The perturbation theory gives a simple analytic platform for potentially engineering new resonator designs.},

  author={Askham, Travis and Zheng, Peng and Aravkin, Aleksandr and Kutz, J Nathan},
  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1712.01883},
  year={2017},
  abstract={The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) is a broadly applicable dimensionality reduction algorithm that approximates a matrix containing time-series data by the outer product of a matrix of exponentials, representing Fourier-like time dynamics, and a matrix of coefficients, representing spatial structures. This interpretable spatio-temporal decomposition is commonly computed using linear algebraic techniques in its simplest formulation or a nonlinear optimization procedure within the variable projection framework. For data with sparse outliers or data which are not well-represented by exponentials in time, the standard Frobenius norm fit of the data creates significant biases in the recovered time dynamics. As a result, practitioners are left to clean such defects from the data manually or to use a black-box cleaning approach like robust PCA. As an alternative, we propose a framework and a set of algorithms for incorporating robust features into the nonlinear optimization used to compute the DMD itself. The algorithms presented are flexible, allowing for regu- larizers and constraints on the optimization, and scalable, using a stochastic approach to decrease the computational cost for data in high dimensional space. Both synthetic and real data examples are provided.}

  abstract={The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a leading tool for data-driven modeling of dynamical systems, providing a regression framework for fitting linear dynamical models to time-series measurement data. We present a simple algorithm for computing an optimized version of the DMD for data which may be collected at unevenly spaced sample times. By making use of the variable projection method for nonlinear least squares problems, the algorithm is capable of solving the underlying nonlinear optimization problem efficiently. We explore the performance of the algorithm with some numerical examples for synthetic and real data from dynamical systems and find that the resulting decomposition displays less bias in the presence of noise than standard DMD algorithms. Because of the flexibility of the algorithm, we also present some interesting new options for DMD-based analysis.},

  arxiv={1805.03717},
  abstract={The problem of optimally placing sensors under a cost constraint arises naturally in the design of industrial and commercial products, as well as in scientific experiments. We consider a relaxation of the full optimization formulation of this problem and then extend a well-established QR-based greedy algorithm for the optimal sensor placement problem without cost constraints. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this algorithm on data sets related to facial recognition, climate science, and fluid mechanics. This algorithm is scalable and often identifies sparse sensors with near optimal reconstruction performance, while dramatically reducing the overall cost of the sensors. We find that the cost-error landscape varies by application, with intuitive connections to the underlying physics. Additionally, we include experiments for various pre-processing techniques and find that a popular technique based on the singular value decomposition is often sub-optimal.}

  journal={arXiv preprint arXiv:1807.05411},
  year={2018},
  abstract={Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling, signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression in particular has been instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications, variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a new and highly effective approach for regularized regression, called SR3. 
The key idea is to solve a relaxation of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art: (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the improved performance of SR3 across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic and real data, including compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion and TV regularization. To promote reproducible research, we include a companion Matlab package that implements these popular applications.}

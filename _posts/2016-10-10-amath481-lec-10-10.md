In this lecture we began discussing the
finite difference framework for solving
ODE boundary value problems in one dimension.
This corresponds with Section 
1.5 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-10.zip).

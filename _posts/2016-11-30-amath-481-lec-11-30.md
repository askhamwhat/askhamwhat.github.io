In this lecture, we reviewed some of the
facts from last lecture about Chebyshev
nodes and Chebyshev polynomials and discussed
the aliasing phenomenon in this context
(recall that aliasing also occurs for 
Fourier modes on equispaced grids).
The material corresponds to Chapters 2--4 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
the first 6 chapters of which can be downloaded
[here](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ATAP/ATAPfirst6chapters.pdf).

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-11-30.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

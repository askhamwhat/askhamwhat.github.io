In this lecture we discussed the von Neumann 
analysis of numerical schemes for time-dependent
PDEs. This corresponds with Section 
3.3 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-14.zip).

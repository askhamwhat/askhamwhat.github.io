In this lecture we discussed the Method of Lines (MOL)
for discretizing partial differential equations which
depend on space and time (this is something we've been
doing all along). 
This corresponds with Section 
3.1 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-04.zip).

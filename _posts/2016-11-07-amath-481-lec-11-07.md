In this lecture we discussed the one-way wave
equation and the CFL condition (which is necessary,
but not sufficient, for convergence).
This corresponds with Section 
3.2 and parts of 3.3 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). Note that the CFL
condition as such is not discussed in the course notes. The
intuitive definition we talked about in this lecture will
suffice for our purposes and we will address it again in
the next lecture. You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-11-07.zip).

I recently attended the ICERM workshop on
Fast Algorithms for Generating Static and
Dynamically Changing Point Configurations.
While there, I presented some work on an adaptive integral
equation approach to inhomogeneous equations
You can view a video of the talk alongside
the slides [on ICERM's video archive](https://icerm.brown.edu/video_archive/#/play/1485). A list of speakers and
attendees can be found [here](https://icerm.brown.edu/programs/sp-s18/w2/)

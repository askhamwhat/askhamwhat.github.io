In this lecture, we wrapped up our discussion
of spectral methods for ODEs and PDEs. 
The material corresponds to Chapter 21 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
which is not freely available (though much
of it is contained in `ch21.m` which
can be downloaded [here](http://www.chebfun.org/ATAP/)).
See also Chapter 4 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). Another good resource
for this material is Nick Trefethen's "Spectral
Methods in MatLab" (from which we borrow
several examples).

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-12-09.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

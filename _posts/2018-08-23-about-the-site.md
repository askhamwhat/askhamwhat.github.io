In case anyone is curious, here are some details
of the site's infrastructure. 

Underneath, the pages are created using the static
site generator [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/). This
allows you to use templates to create pages quickly
and includes blog support (blog posts and web pages
may be written using markdown). Using Jekyll, you can
also serve your website locally to preview the 
final results. For hosting, I use 
[GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/)
which is free and includes Jekyll support. To get 
started with all of this I followed 
[this guide](http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/) 
by Jonathan McGlone. 

The style of the pages is based on the [Hydeout theme](https://github.com/fongandrew/hydeout)
by Andrew Fong, which is an update of the deprecated [Hyde theme](https://github.com/poole/hyde)
by Mark Otto.

In this lecture we reviewd the finite difference 
framework for solving nonlinear ODE boundary value 
problems in one dimension and discussed the ieee 
floating point standard.
This corresponds with Section 
1.5 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf) and [this handout](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/floating_point.pdf) on floating point. You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-10-14.zip).

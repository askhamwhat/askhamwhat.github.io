In this lecture we introduced the concept of a boundary
value problem and the shooting method for obtaining
solutions. We also went in some depth on the bisection
method for root finding. This corresponds with Section 
1.4 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-10-07.zip).

In this lecture we covered the standard "integrators"
(Adams-Basforth and Runge-Kutta), corresponding to
Section 1.1 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-09-30.zip).

For some of the background for this lecture, the
following Wikipedia pages are useful:

- [Jacobian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jacobian_matrix_and_determinant)
- [Numerical integration](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Numerical_integration). We will talk more about numerical integration later in the course.
- [Stiff equation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stiff_equation). We will
likely talk about stiff equations in the next lecture.

For additional reading, here are some more advanced techniques (these
are available for viewing on campus):

- [DIRKs](http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/0714068)
- [Runge-Kutta-Fehlberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Runge%E2%80%93Kutta%E2%80%93Fehlberg_method). The basis of RK45.
- [Spectrally Deferred Corrections](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1023/A:1022338906936) Ultra high order methods.
- [Parareal](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parareal) Parallel-in-time 
integrators.

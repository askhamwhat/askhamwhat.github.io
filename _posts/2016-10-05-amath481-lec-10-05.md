In this lecture we finished discussing the standard 
error analysis and numerical stability 
for one-step methods. This corresponds with Section 
1.3 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-05.zip).

I mentioned a few changes to the quizzes, schedule,
and project in lecture today. These will be reflected on
the course web page soon.

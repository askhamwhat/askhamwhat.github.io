Lamentably this post records known errors
in my [thesis](/assets/publications/pdf/askham2016integral.pdf).

- The error bounds for the local contribution of
the integral in the "heuristic" discussion of section
1.4.7 are incorrect. A better explanation for the
convergence rate of these methods can be found in
the follow-up paper:

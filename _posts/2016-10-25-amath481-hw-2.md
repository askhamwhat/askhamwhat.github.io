Homework 2 is due 11/5.

Please submit your write-up and figures through 
[Canvas](https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1062858/assignments/3460103) by midnight
of the due date. For this assignment, upload everything
as a single pdf. Submit the requested 
MatLab files (see assignment for details) to 
SCORELATOR by midnight (technically, the cut-off is
3 am).

This assignment is quite long but a lot of it is
explanation. The mathematical background part will
test your memory of vector calculus quite a bit. 
Do your best to try to solve them on your own but
feel free to ask for help if you're stuck.

It may be helpful to review the lectures from 
10/24 and 10/26.

We recommend posting questions about the assignment

(enrolled students only).

#### Description

In homework 2, we ask you to do some of the analysis
for the vorticity-streamfunction formulation on 
periodic domains and to derive some facts about rank
one modifications to matrices. For the programming component,
you will write some Fourier differentiation routines
and modify a vorticity-streamfunction based fluids solver for 
2D periodic domains.

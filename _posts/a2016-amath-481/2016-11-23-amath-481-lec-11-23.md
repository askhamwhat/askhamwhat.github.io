In this lecture, we briefly discussed the 
finite element method in dimensions higher than
one and discussed the software design and workflow
for the MatLab PDE toolbox. We used the software
to solve the wave equation and potential flow.
This material is presented differently but 
is related to parts of Chapter 5 
of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). 
You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-23.zip). Unfortunately,
the code requires the MatLab PDE toolbox, which
is quite expensive.

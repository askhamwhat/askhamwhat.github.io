In this lecture we discussed direct solution
methods for general square linear systems,
including Gaussian elimination and the LU
decomposition. We also started to discuss some of
the faster solution options available for sparse matrices
and some of the potential pitfalls for solving
higher dimensional problems. 
This corresponds with Section 
2.2 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-19.zip).

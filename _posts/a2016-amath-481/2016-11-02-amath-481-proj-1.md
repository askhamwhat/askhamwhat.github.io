The ~~first installment of the~~ course project is
due December 9th. As a reminder, collaboration 
is not allowed on the project. The homework load
for homework assignments 3 and 4 will be reduced 
(compared with assignments 1 and 2) to accomodate 
the project.
 
You can download the assignment and related materials [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/proj1.zip).

#### Goals

The primary goal of this project is to gain understanding of the
basic mathematical underpinning and algorithmic structure
of the Finite Element Method (FEM) in 1D. You will build
a FEM code and use it to solve some problems motivated by
mathematical physics.

A secondary goal of this project is to practice reading
about and implementing an algorithm on your own (of course,
you are welcome to seek help from the instructor or TA).

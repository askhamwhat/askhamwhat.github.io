In this lecture, we had an overview of the 
Finite Element Method. This is relevant to 
the project, which can be downloaded 
[here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/proj1.zip). 
This material is presented differently but 
is related to parts of Chapter 5 
of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). 
You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-21.zip).

This lecture included the fourth quiz. The quiz and its
solution can be downloaded [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/quiz4.zip).

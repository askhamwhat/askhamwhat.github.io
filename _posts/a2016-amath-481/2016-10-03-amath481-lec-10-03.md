In this lecture we covered the standard error analysis
for one-step methods and began to discuss stability. This
corresponds with Section 1.3 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-03.zip).

This lecture included the first quiz. The quiz and its
solution can be downloaded [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/quiz1.zip).

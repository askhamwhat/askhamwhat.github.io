In this lecture, we elaborated on 
the implementation of spectral methods 
for ODEs using collocation at Chebyshev nodes.
The material corresponds to Chapter 21 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
which is not freely available (though much
of it is contained in `ch21.m` which
can be downloaded [here](http://www.chebfun.org/ATAP/)).
See also Chapter 4 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). 

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-12-07.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

In this lecture, we began discussing Chebyshev
nodes and Chebyshev polynomials. The material corresponds
to Chapter 2 and parts of Chapter 3 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
the first 6 chapters of which can be downloaded
[here](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ATAP/ATAPfirst6chapters.pdf).
We will be working a lot with the Chebfun MatLab
package which can be downloaded and installed 
following the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-28.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

In this lecture, we discussed the problem of 
interpolation in general and as implemented in
Chebfun.
The material corresponds to Chapter 5 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
the first 6 chapters of which can be downloaded
[here](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/trefethen/ATAP/ATAPfirst6chapters.pdf).

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-12-02.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

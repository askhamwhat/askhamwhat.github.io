In this lecture we reviewed the methods we've 
discussed so far for analyzing the stability 
of numerical integration schemes. These methods include
the CFL condition, the von Neumann analysis, and the 
concept of stability regions. This corresponds with Sections 
3.4 and 3.5 of the [course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-11-16.zip).

In this lecture we gave an overview of the 
example problem for Chapter 2: the solution of
the vorticity-streamfunction formulation of
two dimensional fluids using the finite difference
method. 
This corresponds with Section 
2.1 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-10-17.zip).

This lecture included the second quiz. The
quiz and its solution can be downloaded
[here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/quiz2.zip).

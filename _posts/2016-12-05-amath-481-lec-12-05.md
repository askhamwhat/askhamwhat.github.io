In this lecture, we began discussing 
the implementation of spectral methods 
for ODEs using collocation at Chebyshev nodes.
The material corresponds to Chapter 21 of 
"Approximation Theory and Approximation Practice",
which is not freely available (though much
of it is contained in `ch21.m` which
can be downloaded [here](http://www.chebfun.org/ATAP/)).

You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-12-05.zip). For 
the code to run, be sure that you have downloaded
Chebfun and have added the chebfun directory
to your path. See the directions [here](http://www.chebfun.org/download/).

This lecture included the fifth and final quiz.
The subject of the quiz was the Lagrange interpolating
idea, in its various forms. You can download the
quiz and its solution [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/quiz5.zip)

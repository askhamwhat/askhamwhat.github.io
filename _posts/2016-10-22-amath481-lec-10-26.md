This corresponds with the first half of Section 2.5 of the 
[course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). The second half of Section 2.5 was covered in the lectures
on direct and iterative solvers for linear systems.
You can download the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-10-26.zip).

In this lecture, we finished the discussion of
the faster solution options available for sparse matrices
and some of the potential pitfalls for solving
higher dimensional problems. Then, we reviewed the 
classical iterative methods (Jacobi and Gauss-Seidel) and
briefly mentioned the more "modern" options (Krylov methods:
conjugate gradients and GMRES). As always, you're encouraged
to play around with the code from lecture. In particular, please
take a look at the script `golap.m`, which we didn't have time
to explore fully in lecture.
This corresponds with Section 
2.3 (and part of section 2.5) of the 
[course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-21.zip).

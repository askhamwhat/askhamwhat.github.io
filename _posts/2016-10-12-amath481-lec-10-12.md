In this lecture we continued discussing the
finite difference framework for solving
ODE boundary value problems in one dimension
and introduced Newton's method for finding
the root of a nonlinear function.
This corresponds with Section 
1.5 of the [course notes](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/581-notes-kutz.pdf). You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/teaching/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/resources/lec-10-12.zip).

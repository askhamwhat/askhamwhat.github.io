In this lecture, we develop a fast Poisson solver
for 2D periodic problems. This relies on the Fourier
series representation of periodic functions, which
is reviewed. Here is the lecture video:

This corresponds with Section 2.4 of the 
[course notes](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/581-notes-kutz.pdf).
I diverge from the notes pretty strongly in that
I emphasize the interpretation of the FFT as computing
the coefficients of a Fourier series. I recommend
reading the notes for a different perspective. You can download
the sketches and code from lecture [here](/assets/courses/uw-amath-481-a-2016/lec-10-24.zip).

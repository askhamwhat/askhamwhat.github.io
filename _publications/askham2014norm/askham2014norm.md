abstract: We investigate the behavior of integral formulations of variable coefficient
  elliptic partial differential equations in the presence of steep internal layers.
  In one dimension, the equations that arise can be solved analytically and the condition
  numbers estimated in various Lp norms. We show that high-order accurate Nystrom
  discretization leads to well-conditioned finite-dimensional linear systems if and
  only if the discretization is both norm-preserving in a correctly chosen Lp space
  and adaptively refined in the internal layer.

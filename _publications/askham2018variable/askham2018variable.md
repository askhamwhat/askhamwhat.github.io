abstract: The dynamic mode decomposition (DMD) has become a leading tool for data-driven
  modeling of dynamical systems, providing a regression framework for fitting linear
  dynamical models to time-series measurement data. We present a simple algorithm
  for computing an optimized version of the DMD for data which may be collected at
  unevenly spaced sample times. By making use of the variable projection method for
  nonlinear least squares problems, the algorithm is capable of solving the underlying
  nonlinear optimization problem efficiently. We explore the performance of the algorithm
  with some numerical examples for synthetic and real data from dynamical systems
  and find that the resulting decomposition displays less bias in the presence of
  noise than standard DMD algorithms. Because of the flexibility of the algorithm,
  we also present some interesting new options for DMD-based analysis.

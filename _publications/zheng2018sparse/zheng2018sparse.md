abstract: 'Regularized regression problems are ubiquitous in statistical modeling,
  signal processing, and machine learning. Sparse regression in particular has been
  instrumental in scientific model discovery, including compressed sensing applications,
  variable selection, and high-dimensional analysis. We propose a new and highly effective
  approach for regularized regression, called SR3. The key idea is to solve a relaxation
  of the regularized problem, which has three advantages over the state-of-the-art:
  (1) solutions of the relaxed problem are superior with respect to errors, false
  positives, and conditioning, (2) relaxation allows extremely fast algorithms for
  both convex and nonconvex formulations, and (3) the methods apply to composite regularizers
  such as total variation (TV) and its nonconvex variants. We demonstrate the improved
  performance of SR3 across a range of regularized regression problems with synthetic
  and real data, including compressed sensing, LASSO, matrix completion and TV regularization.
  To promote reproducible research, we include a companion Matlab package that implements
  these popular applications.'

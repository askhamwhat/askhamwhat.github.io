abstract: "We consider a new class of periodic solutions to the Lugiato\u2013Lefever\
  \ equations (LLE) that govern the electromagnetic field in a microresonator cavity.\
  \ Specifically, we rigorously characterize the stability and dynamics of the Jacobi\
  \ elliptic function solutions of the LLE and show that the dn solution is stabilized\
  \ by the pumping of the microresonator. In analogy with soliton perturbation theory,\
  \ we also derive a microcomb perturbation theory that allows one to consider the\
  \ effects of physically realizable perturbations on the combline stability, including\
  \ effects of Raman scattering and stimulated emission. Our results are verified\
  \ through full numerical simulations of the LLE cavity dynamics. The perturbation\
  \ theory gives a simple analytic platform for potentially engineering new resonator\
  \ designs."

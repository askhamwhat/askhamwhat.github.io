abstract: "We present a novel integral representation for the biharmonic Dirichlet\
  \ problem. To obtain the representation, the Dirichlet problem is first converted\
  \ into a related Stokes problem for which the Sherman\u2013Lauricella integral representation\
  \ can be used. Not all potentials for the Dirichlet problem correspond to a potential\
  \ for Stokes flow, and vice-versa, but we show that the integral representation\
  \ can be augmented and modified to handle either simply or multiply connected domains.\
  \ The resulting integral representation has a kernel which behaves better on domains\
  \ with high curvature than existing representations. Thus, this representation results\
  \ in more robust computational methods for the solution of the Dirichlet problem\
  \ of the biharmonic equation and we demonstrate this with several numerical examples."

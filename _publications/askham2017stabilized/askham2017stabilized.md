abstract: "The modified biharmonic equation is encountered in a variety of application\
  \ areas, including streamfunction formulations of the Navier\u2013Stokes equations.\
  \ We develop a separation of variables representation for this equation in polar\
  \ coordinates, for either the interior or exterior of a disk, and derive a new class\
  \ of special functions which makes the approach stable. We discuss how these functions\
  \ can be used in conjunction with fast algorithms to accelerate the solution of\
  \ the modified biharmonic equation or the \u201Cbi-Helmholtz\u201D equation in more\
  \ complex geometries."

Some of my scientific software is available
under open source licenses on [my personal GitHub page](https://github.com/askhamwhat) and [my lab GitHub page](https://github.com/duqbo).

- [mbh2dfmm](https://github.com/duqbo/mbh2dfmm) --- a Fortran
software package for computing stable, fast sums with the
modified biharmonic kernel. Also includes julia wrappers.
- [optdmd](https://github.com/duqbo/optdmd) --- a 
MATLAB software package for computing the 
optimized dynamic mode decomposition (DMD). 
- [varpro2](https://github.com/duqbo/varpro2) --- a 
MATLAB software package for solving separable
nonlinear least squares problems.
- [RobustDMD.jl](https://github.com/UW-AMO/RobustDMD.jl) --- a
julia package for computing the dynamic mode decomposition
with robust penalties.

I work primarily in the field of scientific
computing, which broadly seeks to explore and
understand scientific phenomena with the aid of
a computer. The primary goal of such research is
to improve the software and algorithms available
for the computer-aided design of modern devices,
control systems, and therapeutics.

### Integral equation methods for PDEs

My Ph.D. thesis focused on integral-equation methods
for the solution of inhomogeneous elliptic partial
differential equations in complex geometry. It can be
downloaded [here](/assets/papers/thesis.pdf).
Known [errata](/thesis-errata).


### Reduced order modeling

Direct numerical simulation of complex physical
systems, e.g. the fluid flow around an intricate
geometry, can
require an incredibly large number of degrees of
freedom to represent the solution. Often, however,
we are actually concerned with how the behavior of
such systems changes as a function of a small number
of system parameters.
The reduced order modeling paradigm is based on the
idea that because the space of system parameters
is lower dimensional, it is sometimes possible to
represent all possible solutions of interest in
terms of a relatively small set of basis functions.
This reduced basis can then be used to design
an approximately optimal control system or
to perform short term future-state prediction.
